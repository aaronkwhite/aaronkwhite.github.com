    <p>When not working on Projects I like to focus on my Photography, Playing the Guitar, renovating my new house and spending time on the web learning about new technologies/techniques so I can integrate them into my work.</p>

    <p>You can follow me on Twitter or check out my Flickr Photostream if you'd like to get a better idea of what I'm up to. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, trivia or any general statements of fact that I may not be aware of.</p>
