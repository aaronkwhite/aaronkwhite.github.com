<p>I’ve been stock piling some screenshots of various design related content I’ve seen on the web and in this case training I’ve had to complete.  throughout the next few days/weeks I plan on writing about my thoughts/complaints about Annoying Design.  And here we go:</p>

<p>Last week I had to complete some compliance training for work… HAD TO, was the Final Day or my name went on a naughty list of people who haven’t completed the compliance training…  Before each CBT (Computer Based Training) assessment actually started you are required to read some legal jargon and click a button to acknowledge that you read and understood, well maybe not understood but at least read the legalese. These particular CBT Assessments required that your scroll down the ENTIRE page and read ALL of the text before you could proceed, see screenshot:</p>

<p>[![Look at all the whitespace above the Text!][2]][2]
Look at all the whitespace above the Text!</p>

<p>[![You must scroll down to see a single line of text!][3]][3]
You must scroll down to see a single line of text!</p>

<p>This is what I would consider not only Bad but Super Annoying design… You’ll notice the very small amount of space the scroll bar must proceed to read ONE line of text and ALL the whitespace located at the top of the window.  I’m not sure if this was coded this way to ensure that you actually read the text, or if the developer has a wicked sense of humor. Either way for the user it is extremely frustrating and I imagine for the developer if you corrected the spacing issue, there would be less code since the Scroll to Bottom alert would not be needed. I do have to admit that I didn’t investigate screen resolution issues, however the window is not resizable.</p>

<p>What to take away from this?  Well when designing anything you need to be conscious of how users interact with your design/interface.  Most users today have larger screens and higher resolutions so you should design your layout for that median group (most common resolutions &amp; screen sizes).  It is possible to create a clean, clear, spacious design without introducing such annoyances as having to scroll down for a single line of text.  Good luck on your designs, I hope this was somewhat helpful…</p>

<p>-Big A</p>

<p>Note: I’m intentionally ignoring the topic of Accessibility, strictly focusing on my interaction with this CBT and what I can take away from it in my designs.  Also since I know you’re dying to know… I passed all my compliance training!</p>
