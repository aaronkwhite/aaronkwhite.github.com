<p>I’ve come to the realization that my job title, professional statement and careers summary (all resume terms/categories) should all say ‘Professional Problem Solver’.  OK!  You’re asking yourself WTF?  What on earth does this have to do with Web Design?  My response is EVERYTHING!  What is Web Design or Web Development than creative problem solving? I find that I spend most of my day solving problems, whether it’s design related or fixing annoying IE7 bugs.  I’ve been working with some small business who are looking to update their web presence to drive traffic and increase business… ALL Problem Solving!</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong> = How do we increase our business?</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong> = Besides hiring me to build your site obviously (shameless plug, I know) Architect a site that pulls traffic and provides an easy way for consumers to get in touch with business owners.</p>

<p>This example sounds pretty obvious and it is to a degree, but you would be surprised how many do it yourselfers and so called web design/development types don’t take this into consideration when building sites.  YES Here is a Super Awesome looking site and your email address… which is built in tables, doesn’t have meta information and the HTML/PHP/ASP/etc.. is CRAP!  None of this solves the problem of driving traffic and hopefully increasing business/sales for the customer.</p>

<p>When building websites/interfaces/applications I suggest asking yourself the fundamental questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What problem are we trying to solve</li>
<li>Does this solution address or solve this problem</li>
</ol>


<p>If you answer NO to the second question them you can refine your solution to address the shortcomings.  If you build a site and never ask yourself either question then I believe you are doomed to FAIL, but you’ll have a pretty website <img src="http://www.aaronkwhite.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" />  I believe everything I build needs to be viewed as problem solving, which helps me deliver exceptional solutions to my customers.</p>
