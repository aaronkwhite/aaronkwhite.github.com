<p>The original title of this post was going to be</p>

<blockquote><p>“How to get <a href="http://www.damondnollan.com" title="Damond Nollan">Damond Nollan</a> to publish more Blog posts: An exercise in Responsive Webdesign”</p></blockquote>

<p>but even I realize the drop in SEO value there kids <img src="http://www.aaronkwhite.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" /></p>

<p>The other day I wrote a post about <a href="http://www.aaronkwhite.com/2012/web-development/responsive-web-design-in-action/">Responsive Web Design in Action</a>, showcasing the <a href="http://svt.se/ug" title="Swedish Broadcaster’s Responsive Web Design">Swedish Broadcaster’s new site</a>. The process of designing a responsive site usually begins with the mobile view first and then addressing larger view such as a tablet or browser window at various widths. Having never designed (or developed) a responsive site before I decided to take on the design part of this challenge.</p>

<p>Since I was listening to my buddy <a href="http://blogtalkradio.com/damondnollan" title="Room 3026 Live">Damond’s daily Podcast (Room 3026 Live over on Blog Talk Radio)</a> I thought I’d take shot at fixing up his blogger website (*note I’m pretty sure this is not possible in Blogger, so Damond will need to migrate to WordPress!). I mentally set out a few goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mobile first, then the Browser</li>
<li>Add some Pretty Fonts &amp; a new logo</li>
<li>Incorporate specific elements (such as the advertising &amp; social media elements)</li>
<li>Address the overall readability</li>
</ul>


<p>A few hours later and I had what I think is a solid starting place for a nice Responsive Blog:</p>

<p>[![][7]][7]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are two primary views required here, the full screen page viewable in a browser (above) and the thin mobile view (below). You should be able to get the content to dynamically shrink enough to where it’s readable on a tablet and then switch to the single column view for mobile devices. All that being said, I think there is the possibility for a third in-between view where the navigation from the mobile view replaces the sidebar on a tablet. This is the great thing about Responsive designs, the limitations on what you can do are endless.</p>

<p>[![][8]][8]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Since this was something I literally threw together in a few hours, it’s not perfect! I didn’t use a grid to do the layout, I’m not sure which grid is best for responsive design yet so I eye-balled the positioning. I’ve also made a handful of assumptions about the development, such as using javascript to resize content, images and hacking some CSS to make sure everything works as intended.</p>

<p>Overall I think this is a great update to Damond’s blog… maybe one of these days he’ll let me migrate it all over to WordPress. A Girl can dream can’t she?</p>
