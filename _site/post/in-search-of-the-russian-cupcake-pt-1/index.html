<p>Mrs. Cupcake is currently in Moscow, Russia for her new gig. So Mr. Cupcake (that would be ME) has decided to share the hilarious emails I’ve been getting from the Mrs. since they seem to revolve around food and electrical fires… I hope you enjoy the following as much as I did…</p>

<p>-Mr. Cupcake</p>

<blockquote><p>We are currently staying in an apartment that is attached to the same building that the office is in, so we are avoiding any kind of cold walk early in the morning, which is just fine with me. <img src="http://www.aaronkwhite.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /> We will be staying in the apartments the first 10 days that we are here and then will be moving to a Marriott that is downtown Moscow.</p>

<p>We went out yesterday after we arrived to pick up a few groceries and get something to eat. The ‘store” we thought was the grocery store, was actually a health club. English is hardly spoken by anyone. We did not encounter anyone who spoke English until we arrived at the office this morning-which made yesterday even more interesting.</p>

<p>So, at the health club, we went in to ask for directions to a food store. What we got was a bunch of Russian written on a piece of paper and a very vague idea about the location of the store. We ended up finding something the size of a small convenience store. When you went in there are three cash registers and about 6 ladies working in there. Like I said, no one speaks English, and all of the products were written in Russian, so it was a picture matching experience. The store was very very busy, with a constant stream of Russians coming in to purchase items. You cannot just walk down aisles to pick things up. You have to ask for everything as it is all behind the counter. Try communicating to 6 Russian ladies who want nothing to do with you and can’t understand you, and who are distracted by real customers that they can easily communicate with. I ended up with a baguette and a block of cheese. No water, no coffee, nothing else. My co-workers ended up with anything from wine to nescafe. One of them got water (with gas) and didn’t realize what he was getting. Needless to say, he hates the bubbles so I ended up with his water.</p>

<p>We have a Russian person working with us. His name is Alex and he functions as our interpreter and as an extra person to help us complete our work. I asked him about the store this morning and he said that it is the result of the “old system” meaning, it is a left over from the Communist system, and that is how many stores still work here. It was common at that time for the stores to better control their inventory and avoid theft if everything was behind the counter and the registers controlled a small area of counter space.</p>

<p>In general, being here is like stepping back into the 1980′s. The décor resembles that time. My apartment has wood floors and red carpet. Pink tile and pink rugs in the bathroom. It is is larger than what I expected and even has a deck. It gets dark here around 5pm and doesn’t get light out in the morning until about 7:30am.</p>

<p>I slept only about 3 hours on our trip over here. I started reading a great book and it was so good I didn’t want to sleep plus I couldn’t sleep very well. Out trip from Denver to Chicago was on a 777. My Dad would have been jealous. It’s his favorite plane. Thankfully, I ended up in one of the side rows, where there are 2 seats. Michael, my co-worker also attached my reservation to his and well, he’s flown 85K miles this year, so I was able to secure an economy plus seat. In Chicago, we switched to another 777 for our trip to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, we went through a couple of security checks and then had to transfer terminals to catch our connection to Moscow. In the main hall of the airport there was this amazing buttery flaky pastry smell. And it was 5am, so of course, we had to stop and have a croissant. I had a chocolate one along with a latte and it was heavenly. We then proceeded to our gate and after a short wait boarded our plane to Moscow.</p>

<p>My seat was in the last row of the plane. Thankfully, the plane wasn’t overly full, and there was an open seat between me and the other person in my row. Russians are very friendly with each other on planes. Everyone talks to everyone and it is like social hour. And Lufthansa serves a huge breakfast. So, I read my book and before I knew it we were almost in Moscow. Flying in, I could see many small villages. The houses seemed to resemble barn like structures, but there were quite a few of these. There were many decidious trees and some evergreens too covering the landscape. We deplaned and walked right into a cloud of smoke, as everyone in the airport was smoking. We made it through customs although the customs agent didn’t speak English and was trying to get me to fill out the departure portion of my customs documentation. She used hand gestures and I figured it out. We walked out of customs to meet our driver. We didn’t locate him for about 15 minutes, but we found him and piled into his car. There are quite a few cars here, some old russian models, which I will have to take a picture of, and then modern vehicles that we are all used to. Our drive from the airport was about 40 minutes. We checked into the apartments, and unloaded our stuff. We then went out to explore which I explained above.</p>

<p>Last night I slept okay. I went to bed at 8pm, and woke up many many times. (sometimes because I was receiving text messages from the US since it was day time there). I set my alarm for 6am. When it went off, I decided to reset it for 6:30 since I had until 8am to meet up with my coworkers. At 7:40, I received another text message, and shot out of bed. Clearly, I didn’t turn my alarm back on again like I thought I had.</p>

<p>I jumped in the shower and then at 7:50 someone was knocking on my door. Thankfully, it was one of my coworkers telling me that no one was at the office and we wouldn’t be meeting at 8. This was good for me as I still had sopping wet hair. To remedy the sopping wet hair, I attempted to use the hair dryer provided in the apartment. I couldn’t get it to work, so I got out mine and attached my adapter. I noticed that it seemed that there was a lot of power flowing through the dryer and it was hot. I shut it off after a couple of minutes and when I did, I had a small fire come out of the outlet. So much for the hair dryer. I’ll be leaving that in a Russian dump. I trekked down to one of my other co-workers rooms and we figured out how to use the provided dryer. Then, I came to work, which is where this email started.</p>

<p>I can’t guarantee that I will write this much for each day, but that’s what is going on so far…</p></blockquote>
