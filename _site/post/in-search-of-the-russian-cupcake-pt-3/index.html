<p><strong>Day 3 evening</strong></p>

<p>We had our first good meal tonight. By Russian standards, we went to a fancy restaurant, a steakhouse. I have to admit that this was the first decent meal that I’ve had since being in Russia. Everything worked out quite well. The ride in to the restaurant was about 25 minutes as we were heading into the city against traffic. We ate, drank and truly enjoyed each other’s company. We had a bit of confusion as our waiter did not speak Russian, but using hand gestures, we worked it out quite well. We weren’t quite ready for our taxi cab and apparently as we found out today from the Accounting Manager, they were running late too. They had called her because they were running late so she was very concerned this morning that everything went smoothly. Little does she know that this is the smoothest anything has gone for us since we have arrived.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>

<p>I woke up at a decent hour today and was feeling most energetic of any of the previous days. I’ve been battling a bit of a cold, so it was nice to feel refreshed and like I had slept decently. I did hear from one of my friends back in Chicago during the night who had forgotten that I was going out of town. We didn’t actually talk, since it was 4am when she rang and I didn’t think I would make a very good conversation partner at that time. Anyhow, I finally found the international cnn channel on my television. It was nice to break up the silence in my apartment and catch up a bit on the news. The other english speaking channels that I have found seem to have some form of a David Hasselhof or Hasselhofesque re-run from the 1980′s on it. While it cracks me up every time, I can only stand about 5 minutes of it.</p>

<p>There was a craft bazaar in the building that we work in today. There were over 50 booths of crafts set up with everything from china teacups, to paintings, fur hats, maytroyka sets (russian nesting dolls) and many other handi crafts. At lunch, yes, we skipped the vanilla soy sauce and nasty raisin chocolate, and instead attended the bazaar. All of us (all 5 of us that are here from either the US or Germany) picked up items at the bazaar. I was able to score a few gifts for those back home and had a really fun time trying on different fur hats. I had no idea that they came in so many styles and colors. And now that I’ve heard the weather forecast for the remainder of our trip here (snowy and rainy), I might regret not purchasing one.</p>

<p>I am settling in at work and gaining a better understanding of what I am doing and what I am looking at. I was contacted by the US Company today to re-submit a tax form and a change of address form. While this would normally seem to be a simple 5 minute task it has turned into quite the event. First off, I don’t have the ability to print from my computer. I forward the document to one of my co-workers and he opens it only to inform me that in his version of pdf, he can type into the document. He thinks I’m lazy and sends it back to me. I re-open it to figure out that I don’t have the same version of pdf and can’t type into mine. So, back it goes to him so he can print it and then I can fill it out, sign it and scan or fax it. I ask our PwC resource to help me figure out if the copy machine is capable of scanning or faxing. He confirms that yes, it is capable but requires a user name and password. Fantastic, as I don’t have one. <img src="http://www.aaronkwhite.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" /> So, I email the person back in the US letting her know I am working from a different country and can I send her the forms and then submit ones with my signature later? I’m telling my other co-workers about this and they promptly notify me that I can use my company id and one of our passwords. Again, fantastic but the copy machine has the Cryllic alphabet and well, all of my password is in English and there is not always a direct translation nor would I have the first clue as to what it would be. In case you aren’t catching on yet, what should have taken me less than 5 minutes to complete, I’ve now spent more than an hour trying to figure out and I still haven’t submitted the documentation.</p>

<p>After work we set out to a bookstore that has English books so we could pick up a map for the metro and also a guidebook. Our co-worker who had originally brought the guidebook accidentally left it on the plane when he deplaned in Moscow. He realized it while we were waiting in the Customs line and tried to go back but could not re-access the plane. So, he’ll be purchasing the book that he loaned from the library <img src="http://www.aaronkwhite.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>On our way to the bookstore we stopped for dinner and we went somewhere that I was hoping we would not have to go back to-the Ichiban sushi place. It was either here or McDonalds and since I don’t eat McD’s at home, I decided not to start yet here (notice I said yet as I really have seriously thought about breaking down and doing it). This time, I did not order any sushi. I stuck with soup and noodles which were much better than the sushi. We found the bookstore and after flustering the clerk there by asking where the English book section was, we wandered the store to find it. In a store of thousands of bookshelves, we found less than half of one devoted to English books. And none of those books were guidebooks. If I had wanted to read the classics I would have been in the right place.</p>

<p>Outside the bookstore we saw a very enterprising man. He had set up shop in the Toi Toi. Yes, the port o pot. There were three lined up in a row, close to the bus and metro stops. He had taken the one on the end, somehow made the door a half door, added a shelf and sat inside this port o pot. He cleaned the other 2 toi’s and collected a fee from those utilizing the other two while they waited patiently for the bus.</p>

<p>We went to the big grocery again and got some more breakfast supplies. We headed home and discussed two things that regularly perplex us about this nation.</p>

<ol>
<li>A pack of cigarettes is about a $1.50 and I think everyone in Moscow smokes</li>
<li>Giving change is something that causes you to get yelled at/frowned upon</li>
</ol>


<p>Seriously, everyone smokes. LIKE CHIMNEYS. In food establishments, walking on the street, in the toi toi, everywhere, except our American office. My Mom would be miserable and I’m certain I will have to air out my suitcase for a few weeks after I arrive home.</p>

<p>We’ve managed to get yelled at while at the grocery store, the dry cleaners, and the bank. We’ve needed anywhere from 100 rubles (about 4 USD) to 600 rubles. As it turns out, every single time, the person with the disdain has had the proper amount to give us, they just haven’t wanted to. According to our Russian comrade, this is not uncommon. Even he faces this. I suppose this should make us feel better but it doesn’t. I struggle with the rationale for this but assume it goes back hundreds of years to previous times when cash wasn’t as readily available? I’m totally guessing here but it is making me feel better.</p>

<p>So, that is about it for now. I’m looking forward to spending some time this weekend exploring the city. I’m planning on using the metro system and ended up printing out an on line black and white map, that I subsequently colored in for each line as there are approximately 8 different color metro lines and well, at the rate this trip is going, I certainly would like to avoid getting lost as much as possible.</p>
