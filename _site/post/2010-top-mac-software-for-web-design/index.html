<p>I wanted to take some time and go over a list of essential software I use in Web Development. Not everything I use on a daily basis is on this list, I wanted to cover the most used and essential Apps. I would love feedback on this list and any other products you might be using, so here goes:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com"><strong>Adobe CS4 Master Suite<br/>
</strong></a>I’ve tried just about EVERY image editing software available and the Adobe suite is still the best in my opinion.  The Master Suite is pricey, yet provides you with every piece of software that you might need to get things done.</p>

<p><a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/"><strong>Espresso<br/>
</strong></a>Espresso is my IDE of choice, there are plenty of addons (sugars) for every type of project and I enjoy the overall experience of using Espresso.  There are other more robust IDE’s out there however I hope in the future Espresso will grow to be the best.</p>

<p><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com"><strong>Mailplane<br/>
</strong></a>For my money Gmail is still the best email service on the planet and Mailplane allows me to manage multiple Gmail accounts including Google Apps mail accounts.  You can seamlessly switch from one account to another and not have to login, HUGE time saver!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/"><strong>VMWare Fusion<br/>
</strong></a>If you’re running a Mac (and I hope you are) Fusion is the best way to run Virtual Machines! You create a base install image, and in a few minutes you can easily create custom servers for testing.  VMWare is constantly improving on this app and the future is brighter than ever!</p>

<p><a href="http://wb.mysql.com"><strong>MySQL Workbench<br/>
</strong></a>Yes I’m a little biased, but you can’t find a better GUI for manipulating MySQL databases (local &amp; remote) than Workbench.  The WB team has spent a great deal of effort in improving the Interface and making even the most challenging of tasks simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mamp.info"><strong>MAMP<br/>
</strong></a>MAMP is simply the BEST way to develop WordPress powered sites locally on the Mac. This one almost didn’t make my list, but it allowed me to work on my site update/re-design while driving across Nebraska and save some battery life.  If you are going to Focus in the WordPress space, then this is a must!</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org"><strong>WordPress<br/>
</strong></a>WordPress is a Powerfull site engine and allows literally anyone to deploy a site, not just a blog with very little effort. There are many different apps to build websites, but I think WordPress is great for ALL skill levels.  At times I find that WordPress can be challenging to accomplish certain tasks, but at the end of the day it’s just damn good software.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"><strong>Text Wrangler<br/>
</strong></a>You will always need a text Editor and frankly Text Wrangler is one of the best.  It’s lightweight, customizable and just plain works.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com"><strong>Transmission<br/>
</strong></a>Bit Torrent has a stigma about it, however the technology is badass.  Transmission is best Mac GUI I’ve found for grabbing large Torrent files (like Linux ISO’s), simple, robust and I really like the bandwidth throttling so it doesn’t take over all of your bandwidth.</p>

<p><a href="http://colloquy.info"><strong>Colloquy<br/>
</strong></a>Not everyone is going to need an IRC client, let alone even know what IRC is.  If you do, then Colloquy is the ONLY Mac app.  I’ve been using IRC for team communication in a distributed environment for over 3yrs and this is still a great way to do it.  Plus there is an iPhone/iPad version that works well over 3G.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com"><strong>Freshbooks<br/>
</strong></a>There are many, and I mean MANY different ways to send invoices to clients… Since I don’t do a lot of freelancing Freshbooks worked for my needs and I found it to be a really nice experience, you can generate quotes and even send invoices via Snail Mail.  I highly recommend this to any aspiring Freelancer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com"><strong>Tweetdeck<br/>
</strong></a>I LOVE Twitter! Tweetdeck is a SOLID app for your stable.  If you only have a single account, multiple or prefer to manage ALL of your social media connections in one place, then Tweetdeck is RockSolid.  My only complaint is that Tweetdeck is still an Adobe Air app, hopefully that will change in 2011.</p>

<p>And the Winner is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/"><strong>Chrome<br/>
</strong></a>For the last almost decade I’ve been the Biggest Firefox Fan Boy! Well, 2010 was the year of Chromium, hands down! This is my GO TO Browser on any platform now.  Chrome is FAST, I mean really Fast! There are no memory leak issues like with Firefox, HTML5 &amp; CSS3 are fully supported (as either can be in 2010) and when a page freaks out, I only have to kill the tab not the entire browser.  Firefox is still the primary browser for development (there are too many addons for Firefox) yet Chrome has a few similar plugins to test your latest code and I think 2011 will bring even more.  If you haven’t made the switch yet, then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</p>

<p><strong>Honorable Mention:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com"><strong>Twitter<br/>
</strong></a>Twitter has been the best resource over the last year for finding business, making new connections and resources galore.  Not to mention the earliest source of news across the globe, I dont’ know HOW I’ve lived 33yrs mostly without Twitter!</p>

<p><a href="http://google.com"><strong>Google.com<br/>
</strong></a>Really? I need to explain this one to you?  I tried Bing, is sucked, went back to Google.  I love how in Chrome the URL Bar is also a Google Search bar, type in your search term and you’re off an running on Google.com… Amazing!</p>
