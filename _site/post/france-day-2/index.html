<p>Note to self… next time you travel CHECK THE WEATHER REPORT!  All the rain that is needed in various parts of the United States (ie. California, parts of Texas, Arizona, etc…) has decided to vacation in Western Europe, namely where ever I decide to hang out for the day.  We decided to walk into town today and visit the main market in Versialles.  This was the best idea we’ve had so far!  This particular Market has been in existence for Hundreds of years…  I guess back in 1487 they decided to give the place a make over and renovate.  What is there today are 4 covered areas and a giant square with vendora galour.  I came to discover the most amazing selection of Cheese’s, fresh meats, vegatibles and the largest artichokes I’ve ever seen in my life!  There wasn’t one thing about this market which I did not like, the food was the freshest I’ve EVER seen!</p>

<p>After the Market I went with my wife’s co-worker to the local airport so we could pick up his wife who was flying in from Toulouse.  I have to admit I like the roadways better in France than I did in England, even though I don’t read or speak French navigating the byways was a bit easier (not to mention we had a GPS, but it kept falling off the window since the suction cup was broken).  I did enjoy seeing different parts of the country &amp; city which I would not other wise have seen, since renting a vechile is SUPER expensive!</p>

<p>Later in the Day we went into Paris, which is where I realized that not checking the weather report and subsiquintly forgetting to bring along my rain coat was a REALLY BAD IDEA! Luckily I did bring along an umbrella… Paris is an amazing place, where I haven’t gottent the opportunity to fully explore yet.  We walked around the city a bit, traveled on the Metro, spent some time in a Cafe’ drying off and enjoyed some delicious Cafe au Lait.  Before heading back to Versailles we stopped by the Eiffel Tower to watch the hourly sparkles, which was neat to see however I can see why most people take it for granted.  The tower itself is not very asthetically apeasing and all it does is sparkle…  This can become old very quickly, I am however happy that I did get to see this at least once in my life.</p>

<p>Thoughts…</p>

<ol>
<li>Always make sure to check the weather before you travel, since trying to locate a Big &amp; Tall (Grande un Tailles) store is almost impossible.</li>
<li>Shop for lunch &amp; Dinner at the local Markets, the food &amp; selections will be of better quality and you will save money compared to eating at restuarants, but the restuarants will be yummy as well.</li>
<li>Follow the locals and remember where there is a line food will be worth the wait.</li>
<li>If you go to Europe in the Fall, Bring your Raincoat!</li>
</ol>
