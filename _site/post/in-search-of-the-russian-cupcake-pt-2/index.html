<p><strong>Rest of Day 2-Monday November 11</strong></p>

<p>So, today at work went fine. I talked to one of the payroll ladies and while it was somewhat difficult to understand her we made due. We later learned that the head guy here, who sounds like he is from Texas, has lived here for the past 14 years and speaks perfect Russian. I would have never guessed.</p>

<p>Alex, our interpreter/resource, recommended a few restaurants for us to try and a larger grocery store for us to shop at. So, off we went. It was about a 15 minute walk to the Ichiban. Yes, you read correctly, Ichiban. Apparently, sushi is very popular here, so we thought we’d give it a try. It was eh. Not horrible but not fantastic either. It certainly didn’t come anywhere close to my favorite or any of my favorites for that matter. And I don’t have a desire to go back. The more interesting part about the afternoon and dinner was that we were joined by another co-worker who is not in our group but works for the company and works on some of the same type of things. Her name is Dagmar and she is German. As one of my co-worker started to say tonight “so there are four americans here and people always think that the reputation of americans are spoiled, loud and ungracious” and I finished it with “until you met a German.” Which isn’t what he was going to say but was a perfect ending.</p>

<p>So, the gray dismal society tour continued tonight. We walked further away from our building. There are tons and tons of large ugly apartment buildings here. I noticed tonight that each complex/building is surrounded by a fence (typically a large iron fence) and that there are guards at all of these places. I’m certain that the ugly apartments and the fence are the resulting leftover from the Soviet Union and that living in an apartment was the only way to survive at one time here. In fact, there really are only huge apartment buildings. And car pollution is rampant. Everything is fairly dirty and we were warned not to drink the water. Wish I would have known that 24 hours ago now that I’ve brushed my teeth three times since being here.</p>

<p>While walking to the larger store tonight we walked past an apartment complex that you had to walk through a metal detector to enter the complex. Strange. So, to the store tonight. It was about 100 times bigger than the store last night. More traditional of a store in the western world. I picked up a few more things-milk, cereal, yogurt, a coke and some water. It’s still kind of weird to not know any letters or words as the Cryllic alphabet is not the most user friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>

<p>So, remember how I said the Cryllic alphabet is not so user friendly?? Well, I purchased milk last night. When I went to use it this morning I noted that it was awfully thick and smelled spoiled. I checked the date on it again. It certainly wasn’t expired. Needless to say my cereal was inedible. So I opted to mix cereal in my yogurt instead. Much better! I later found out that I purchased kefir, instead of milk. Ooops. Speaking of eating, it seems to be the most difficult thing about the trip thus far. Not only are we severely limited in our options due to the location of where we are staying, we also have yet to find something that has flavor. First off, there is no place to get breakfast. Not even a cup of coffee. Hence why we picked up items at the grocery. Anyhow, lunch is probably the worst of the three meals. The office provides a free lunch (so I shouldn’t complain and this should explain further how REALLY bad the food is). There are two options, Russian cafeteria style and then a more formal display. The options change each day. Today, it was sweet and sour pork, rice, some cheesy herring casserole, and a dessert. I was actually quite happy to see that today’s fare was chinese as I thought that it should taste better than traditional Russian food that we had for the previous days.</p>

<p>I picked up some sweet and sour pork, rice and an individually packaged cookie with chocolate thingy for the dessert. There were actually two individually packaged items, and I also selected the other. It came in a silver wrapper and appeared to be chocolate. I put soy sauce on my rice and sat down to enjoy my lunch. I went for the rice first as I knew it would be familiar and let’s face it-it’s been since Friday since I have had a good meal. I noticed something peculiar about the soy sauce on the rice-it tasted like vanilla. Yes, that is correct, no salty soy flavor, but vanilla. As in someone got the vanilla mixed up with the soy sauce. Trust me, don’t try it-it’s gross. I then moved onto the sweet and sour pork. I lifted my fork to my mouth, noting that there wasn’t much of a smell emanating from the meal. I then tasted the meat and nothing. That’s right. Orange sauce was on the meat for color but there was certainly absolutely no flavor. So, moving on to other options on my plate I started into the desserts. I went with the silver package first. It looked good. Nice dark chocolate enveloping something light ( I was thinking maybe marshmallow in the middle??). I bit in. And instantly wanted to spit it out. HORRIBLE. Not marshmallow. I don’t know what it is, however the best I can describe is 1000% sweeter than a cadbury egg but with a different texture. On to the next round, I opened up my other dessert. The one with a cookie and chocolate imprinted on the packaging. Saving the best for last, as I always doand today was no exception. I bit in to that one. While I didn’t have an instant reflex to spit it out, I wanted to gag. There were no cookies. Instead, there was soft chocolate with raisin undertones, enveloped by dark chocolate with poppy seeds sprinkled in. I felt ripped off and lied too. Who puts three cookies on a package with chocolate and delivers raisin flavored chocolate? Better question, who actually likes this shite? Certainly not me. Lunch ended and I was yet again disappointed. What does a person have to do to get something decent to eat? Something with the smallest tinge of flavor, the slightest hint of caloric gratification. I am dreaming of food from home right now.</p>

<p>Last night we ate at a place with an identity crisis. The outside had neon lights and strobe lights. Hold that thought, everything is like that here-with neon and strobe lights. The inside had checkered black and white floor, palm trees and a thatched rood. Our waitress seemed to be wearing a traditional Kurdish headdress. And, the place sold hookah. They did however have some English on their menu so I was able to at least read what I was getting myself into. I’m not going to lie, I was not looking forward to ordering anything. Nothing. Absolutely nothing sounded good. It was either covered in gravy, fried or had an ingredient such as tongue (I kid you not). I opted for a salmon dish. I seem to be opting for a lot of fish here. Anyhow, it was better than what I thought but when it arrived one of my co-workers asked what was stuffed in the salmon, “wet cat food?” I will just leave the description at that. We did order a few bottles of wine, which helped ease the pain some. One of the guys decided to order baklava for dessert. When it arrived it was not filo dough, and worst of all, three quarters of it was raisins topped by a pancake texture cake that they were trying to pass off as filo and then topped by something mixed with nuts that I couldn’t discern. Not anywhere close to baklava. To top if off, our check was delivered to us. Upon delivery, we were informed that we could only pay cash for our meal. Thankfully, between the 5 of us, we had enough to cover the meal. Like I said, it was a good thing I had as much wine as what I did.</p>

<p>Tonight, we have made reservations to go to a place beyond walking distance from where we are staying. The accounting manager here recommended it to us and by all accounts it appears to be a steakhouse. I am sincerely hoping that I will be able to eat a decent meal. I am beginning to become very distracted from work as all I want is some food. The Acctg. Manager arranged for the driver to take us to the restaurant and pick us up. This helps tremendously as there are not many English speakers outside of our work environment.</p>

<p>To be continued…</p>
