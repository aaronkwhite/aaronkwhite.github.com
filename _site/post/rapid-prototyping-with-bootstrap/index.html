<p>Lately the BUZZ word in the web world has been <strong><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, the HTML, CSS &amp; JS framework</strong> for quickly designing &amp; developing the front-end for any website or app. <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> is the jumping off point that we’ve all been wanting for decades that would allow us to not have to worry about how we’re going to create a prototype/app and focus on solving the bigger issues like strategy, retention and getting that huge exit.</p>

<p>In the past designers &amp; developers would spend a lot of time creating mock-ups &amp; flows in [insert graphics program here] or coding a static site (basically a quick framework) that would allow them to get 1-2 similar variations of a landing page, on-boarding flow or even an application UI. This might sound like a lot of testing, however compared to the time spent you more than likely wouldn’t be able to test often enough to justify the hours it takes to get a design into code into the wild.</p>

<p>In today’s world of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">LEAN &amp; AGILE focused start-ups</a> &amp; app development, we no longer have to spend days, weeks or even months (yes, Months) getting a process or prototype out the door for testing.</p>

<p>This past week I spent a lot of time trying to solve some big issues around user-flows and on-boarding, since every start-up is trying to solve the user acquisition &amp; retention problem. Time is always a major concern… there is simply not enough of it. We’re always trying to find ways to balance the equation of time spent vs. quick iterations.</p>

<p>By implementing <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, my team at <strong><a href="http://www.empireavenue.com/">Empire Avenue</a></strong> was able to create a completely re-wired on-boarding process, submit an actual working prototype to www.usertesting.com and receive feedback in less than an hour. The entire process looked like this:</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the course of a week we were able to create a process for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brainstorming</li>
<li>Designing &amp; developing a prototype</li>
<li>Submitting for user feedback</li>
<li>Reviewing the process that now allows us to implement various iterations every 2 hours.</li>
</ul>


<p>Think about the impact of receiving targeted feedback on any part of your site or application every 2 hours… in a 12 hour day you can have 6 iterations of your project in front of users and if you are able to fill most of the holes, deploy your change in a day.</p>

<p>Without <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> we would have spent a large chunk of time creating the base HTML, CSS &amp; JS from scratch and I imagine adding at least 6 hours if not an entire day getting a working prototype out the door, let alone 4 different versions. Utilizing <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> has allowed us to stop focusing on the technology and distill the user feedback into a very narrow set of tasks. If you’re trying to find ways to increase productivity, or need to find a better process to get changes out the door and reviewed, then you need to seriously be taking a look at Bootstrap.</p>
