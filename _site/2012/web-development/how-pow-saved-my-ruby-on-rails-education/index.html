<p>I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a part of two winning ideas at <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a>, the first having been built, scrapped, rebuilt and scrapped again only to be built over a weekend by the founder and various teams of developers and designers. The other was an idea I had around improving the <a href="http://nowandforever.us/">wedding website space</a> focussing on beautiful design and simplicity.</p>

<p>My plan was to build the application using Ruby on Rails to take advantage of the simplicity of the platform, a handful of resources in the Denver/Boulder area if I had questions and hopefully the small financial footprint it takes to grow a Rails application.</p>

<p>I left Startup Weekend with a solid co-founder, a really great idea, a strong desire to turn this idea into something real and a huge head start with a chunk of the Rails code already written (It even had Facebook Connect ready to go). The one thing that I didn’t have was the knowledge to build a Ruby on Rails app. Not the biggest hurdle in the world, since there are a ton of resources for learning Rails ( like <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Rails-Experts-Development-ebook/dp/B00486UF0M?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYXLFPZOVJ2LZ4WA&amp;tag=lendle-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00486UF0M">Beginning Rails 3</a>, and a plethora of others).</p>

<p>So I set out to learn Ruby and Rails, reading a couple books at the same time, going through Zombie for Rails and working for a growing startup using PHP everyday. This isn’t a bad thing, I come from a PHP background havng been involved with or using PHP almost my entire career… Just keep in mind I’m a Designer, Front End, UI/UX guy.</p>

<p>So why don’t I know Ruby on Rails? Unlike the PHP world there aren’t clear instructions or easy frameworks such as MAMP to setup your local development environment. There are quite a few web servers, many different configurations and requirements for getting Rails going. Most of these issues are solvable with a few Google searches and some quality time spent in the command line.</p>

<p>My biggest problem was trying to get a Rails development environment setup that would’nt interfere with my work PHP environment, I also wanted to utilize my local MySQL 5.5 installation and not load everything into a virtual machine.</p>

<p>I’ve spent well over 6 months (obviously not every day) trying to solve this core issue… The biggest issue being that the MySQL2 Gem just would not work as advertised. There were a ton of hacks that others were able to get working, but nothing worked for me. I could create the app, but the local web server just couldnt work with my MyQSL install. I didn’t want to use SQLite since I’m way more familiar with MySQL and was planning in using it in Production… Makes sense to learn on what you’re going to use.</p>

<p>An amazing thing happened a few weeks ago… The masterminds behind <a href="http://37signals.com">37Signals</a> released a Rack Dev environment for Rails Rack apps called <a href="http://pow.cx">POW</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Pow is a zero-configuration Rack server for Mac OS X. It makes developing Rails and Rack applications as frictionless as possible.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After installing <a href="http://pow.cx">POW</a> using the remote install script, I was able to access the default laning page in under 5 minutes.</p>

<p>I re-opened my Beginning Rails 3 book in my Kindle iPad app and finally started my journey learning Ruby on Rails. There was one issue once I created the scaffold for the basics blog application where the MySQL gem still didn’t want to play nicely, but after adding some magic to my .profile_bash file pointing to the correct install of MySQL 5.5 and reinstalling the MySQL2 Gem everything magically started to work as expected.</p>

<p>Think of <a href="http://pow.cx">POW</a> as the web server in a box for local Ruby on Rails development. Setup POW, install your flavor of database, throw in a little RVM (Ruby Version Manager), grab the latest version of Rails (currently 3.2 as of this post) and get cranking on your Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>Thanks to this amazing little piece of software I am in the middle of learning all about Rails, IRB, the goodness that is ActiveRecord and am well on my way to making my Startup Weekend idea a reality.</p>
