<p>This design template was created to help designers jumpstart their <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> projects. Recently I’ve found myself relying on the many great features of Bootstrap when designing apps and have become growingly frustrated with having to create the default grid in Illustrator &amp; Photoshop from scratch… I was very surprised to see that Bootstrap templates don’t already exist, so I created this one and am sharing it with the world. The grid layout is based on the default 12 column grid released in the 2.0 version of <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>This template is free to use for any projects (personal &amp; commercial), all I ask is you don’t take credit for my work or the guys who created <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>Please send feedback via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aaronkwhite">Twitter</a> or in the comments below, if you notice any major flaws please let me know…</p>
