You can now paste the blow code into your blog or website to proudly display your Empire Avenue Activity. You will need to replace the BIGA ticker with your ticker, unless you’re a fan ![;-)][1] If you have any issues please let me know, sometimes text editors garble the quotes in the Javascript and the badge wont display. If this happens, just replace the the “” with straight quotes.
