One thing that I can say with 100% certainty is that I value Sleep over standing in line to get an iPhone 4… especially when iPhone’s are still tied to the AT&T Network.  With most technologies I like to let them ‘stew’ if you will before I take that plunge, I would prefer to let others deal with the hassles of new technologies which allows me to sit back learn about the good & bad and then make my decision.  Plus I usually have more options when I wait!

I have an white iPhone 3GS that is less than 2yrs old and it’s a Rock Star!  Especially after I upgraded to iOS4.  The device is sleek, sexy and durable.  In my opinion the worst thing about iPhone 3G/3GS/4 is AT&T! I have horrible cell reception at my house, which is located in a lower elevation compared to the surrounding neighborhoods.  I have to admit that iOS4 has made my call quality a bit more reliable, but it’s not perfect by any means. AT&T isn’t as expensive at Verizon, however getting rid of Unlimited Data plans or asking for my first-born in exchange for unlimited data is just plain stupid!

So, I am going to stick with my 3GS (which hey, is practically new after this upgrade) and wait patiently for the iPhone 4 on T-Mobile/Verizon or wait for the Android handset market to catch up with Apple and give us a decent piece of hardware.
