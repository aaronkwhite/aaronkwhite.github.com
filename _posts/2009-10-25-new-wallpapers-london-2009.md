I just updated my Macbook Pro to Snow Leopard and decided I needed a new Wallpaper, and since I have a TON of photos I took when in London a while ago I figured why not use these images.  So I’ve added a couple evening shots I took of the London Eye & the London Bridge.  Both shots were taken with my Nikon D40  using a 55-200 VR lens.  Enjoy!
