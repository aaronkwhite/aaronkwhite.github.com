This week I launched a site redesign for a non-profit here in Denver, [The Renewable Energy Initiative][1]. The coolest thing about the project? From concept to completion it took 5 days!  I know you’re asking yourself “WHY would you launch a site in 5 days?” Well this past Monday there was a big government press event to talk about some Renewable Energy related things… I don’t recall exactly what details they all covered.

Now the previous week I attended the Boulder Denver NewTech Meetup in Denver, where a group of Non-Profit organizations presented some sort of tech related problem they had and ‘WE THE PEOPLE’ volunteered to help out and give back to a deserving cause.  There were some really cool groups here, for example one group wanted to create a Match.com for people with head injuries (This was the most popular… not surprising).

I decided to help out the Energy Group who are attempting to bring awareness of Renewable Energy Funds that companies can add to their retirement plans… mainly 401(k)s. This was by far the least popular group… I guess dating sites are a lot more fun to work on ![;-)][2]

**The Problem**: TheREI had an existing website and wanted to focus on Newsletter Subscription and Social Media.

**The Solution**: Getting down to the brass tacks actually took us a while, I’m not sure TheREI presenter had a clear idea of what he wanted or needed. After a while it was clear (especially after looking at the existing website) that TheREI was in DIRE need of a site OVERHAUL.  I actually interrupted the conversation and volunteered to redesign the entire site, take a look:

This is a cache version of the site.. but you get the idea

It was decided to focus on the following items for this non-profit:

1.  Redesign the site, cleaning up the content
2.  Center the site architecture on the Newsletter Subscription
3.  Provide the ability for users to Donate to the cause
4.  Limit Social Networking to a LinkedIn group, to limit the time requirement for this small non-profit

The NEW Renewable Energy Initiative

Alas we were able to post this content on Sunday evening and I think it was a successful project. The new site is clean, clear, easy to read and it’s painfully obvious that you should sign up for the newsletter or make a donation.  The best part I think is we were able to leverage existing products to accomplish our goals.  The newsletter system is now powered by [MailChimp.com][5], donations are setup through PayPal and LinkedIn group was super easy to setup. Having the newsletters now powered by MailChimp will allow TheREI to generate text & HTML based emails and manage a database of users FOR FREE!!! Well, free until they blow up and have over 5000 subscribers.

Now, this site isn’t going to win any awards… but I build sites that are effective, easy to look at and solve a problem;  ALL of which were addressed and should provide TheREI with a more effective way to spread their gospel.  I’d like to thank everyone involved in getting this project off the ground, I believe we’re the first group to have a tangible product. Also, HUGE Thanks to the Boulder Denver New Tech for organizing the Non-Profit event… by far the best ‘Denver’ [BDNT][6] ever!
