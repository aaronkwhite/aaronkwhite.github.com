The People's Market

As of last Friday I’ve agreed to do some work for a friend of mine up in the Great North (Canada) as the UI/UX Engineer at Empire Avenue.  Empire Avenue is a bit challenging to explain at first, but at it’s essence is a ‘stock-market’ environment except for people.  Wow, that is disturbing… actually it’s extremely interesting and quite fun!  Basically you’re ‘valuation’ is based on not just how often users buy & sell your ‘stock’, but how active you are in the virtual world… Blogging, Twitter, Facebook etc… help you increase your value.

The Beta testing has been a rousing success and by the end of March we should be open for a larger Invite Only access. I’m very excited about this little venture, the team is amazing and a lot of fun to work with.  Hopefully in the near future we’ll be able to rollout some awesome features and get a bit more into the nuts and bolts of the Empire.

If you are interested in signing up for the Beta or want a better chance of getting into the Invite Only Access, send me a message and I’ll see what strings I can pull ![;-)][2]
