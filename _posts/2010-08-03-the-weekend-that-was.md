I feel like I need to talk a bit about my first weekend off in a while as part of my Startup Life series (hopefully there will be more to come). This last stretch was about 7 weeks in duration, maybe a bit longer if you include the trip to Edmonton where I had to fly to the opposite side of the country to get home, but I digress…

This past weekend I did not sit in front of my computer except to check my email and the weather! I finally moved the sprinkler heads from around the house to the garden, mowed my lawn did a bit of shopping, grilled Salmon on cedar planks for the first time, finally on Sunday bought Batman Arkham Asylum (which is a Great Game) and played for about 5 hours.

It was the most wonderful weekend I’ve had in a very long time. Moral of this story? No matter if you work for a large behemoth, medium sized, family owned or a startup company, make sure you take time off to do what you love! Stay away from work for at least 48 hours, or at the very least go drinking ![;-)][1]
