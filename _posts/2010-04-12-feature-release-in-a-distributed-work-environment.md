As I am typing this post, the EmpireAvenue crew is in the process of publishing a new set of Feature Enhancements. We’ve blogged about our distributed work environment on the official blog before so I just wanted to chime in on how effective and awesome it is to work in thus environment. Most of the team is somewhere in Canada while I’m in Denver jamming to ‘Street Sweeper Social Club’ and hanging out in our IRC room waiting for the ‘Go Live’ button to be pushed. 

There it goes.. we’re up and running with a new set of feature enhancements. Don’t see any real changes? Well I would go and buy some User Advertising or add a new blog to your profile… Working from home is great, but having the ability to crank some tunes while pushing new features live, well… it’s EPIC!
