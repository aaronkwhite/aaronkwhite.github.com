So, this is a little bit un-eventful… Everything  worked as planned! ![:-D][1]   This is the 3rd WordPress upgrade I’ve done in just about 1 month.  I’m using GoDaddy shared hosting which  a lot of people bash on, but I have never had any issues.  The GoDaddy default was version 2.6.3 I believe, and I have been using 2.6.5 for at least a month.

I think it’ll take me a little time before I start to notice any issues, however while attempting to upload this image:

the Flash uploader did not work for me… honestly I don’t really feel like spending the time to investigate at this point, besides the browser uploader seems to be working just fine.  Anyway, 2.7 is installed and working, I did not have to change anything to my theme.  All is Good!
