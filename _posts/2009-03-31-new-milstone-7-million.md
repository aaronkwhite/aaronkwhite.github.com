Just a few hours ago www.mysql.com surpassed 7 Million monthly vists, I don’t have a final number since we still have a fews hours to go.  I’m so excited about this, our team works extremely hard to deliver a solid web presence and the world is taking notice of our products.  There are a lot of rumors and discussions about Open Source software rising to the challenge in the current economic climate and I think this is a clear sign that people & businesses are looking for alternatives.  Congrats to the entire MySQL family!
