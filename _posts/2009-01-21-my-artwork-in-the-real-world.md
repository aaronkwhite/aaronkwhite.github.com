Last week was the one year anniversary of the MySQL Acquisition by Sun Microsystems, so our Community team is running a ’5 Days of MySQL & Sun’ promotion, where yours truly created some nifty Banner artwork. Everyday is a different theme… I found these kickass ‘Robot’ illustrations on iStockphoto that worked really well with what we’re doing.

I admit that there is nothing above and beyone in the banners but, hey!  They look pretty sweet…
