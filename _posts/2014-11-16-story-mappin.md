With the release of Jeff Pattons new book "[User Story Mapping](http://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909)", I thought I'd share the slide deck I've been using to explain how to create story maps with my team.

Sticky notes and sharpies can be powerful tools... however everyday they are used incorrectly, so let's start building better story maps!
