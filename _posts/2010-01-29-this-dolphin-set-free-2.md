Today is my last day working for MySQL…  These are 8 words that I never imagined I would have to say or write when I accepted the position almost two years ago.  I have been told that MySQL the product and MySQL the web properties will live on, however I’m not sure in what form or fashion.  The last ~2 years have been some of the most wonderful, exciting, frustrating and fulfilling of my entire life. I am extremely grateful to everyone in the organization for allowing me to insert my wacky sense of humor daily and let my creativity blossom.

I am not sure what the future holds, but I can be sure that my experiences within MySQL I am prepared for anything that may come my way.  I wish the best for everyone left standing and hope they can keep pushing the Open Source mantra and keep some sense of what it means to be a MySQL Dolphin alive in this new world.
