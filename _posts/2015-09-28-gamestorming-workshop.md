This is a workshop I gave on using Gamestorming to create highly engaging and collaborative learning environments as a part of Denver Startup Week 2015.

Meetings don’t have to be boring. Imagine you had a toolbox full of techniques for creating fun and engaging learning environments. Gamestorming introduces boundaries to the problem space and utilize game mechanics to spur creativity and naturally drive engagement.

Long Brainstorming sessions are exhausting and don’t always generate the new or great ideas. At this workshop you will learn the principles of gamestorming that are fast, versatile and incredibly impactful for generating new ideas and solving problems. You will put these new techniques into play with other attendees and create an enabling environment for creativity.
