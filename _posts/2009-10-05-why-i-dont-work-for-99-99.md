I’ve been thinking about this post for a little while and over the weekend I finally had some time to pull together a mock-up for a side project I inquired about doing a few months ago.  I was attending a local Tech event in Downtown Denver and met the Owner/Salesperson type for CollarCard.com and they were looking for some site updates, SEO, Adwords help.  I chatted a bit with this person, gave him my contact info and setup a time to talk about the project.

Basically I went to [www.collarcard.com][1] and was SHOCKED to see a relatively new start-up using a Dark, Un-Usable, TABLE based design.  I sent in my proposal to perform basic SEO makover (getting rid of the tables STAT!) and helping out with their Adwords management… Oh and my reduced hourly rate.  Having worked with small businesses in the past I was prepared for a counter offer, keep in mind my figure was below $900 since I was going to keep the existing design.  ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  that was their counter offer, **ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS!** I did counter with a lower figure, which was nowhere near ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS! which was turned down so I obviously walked away…

Over the weekend I spent about ~2hrs coming up with a Mock-Up in Photoshop (keep in mind most Web Design take a week at least if not longer) which I believe addresses a couple issues with the existing site:

*   Compliant/Accessible Design (NO TABLES)
*   Readable, no dark text on a dark background
*   Easy to find/use Navigation
*   Web 2.0 Asthetic (Nice Shadows, Rounded Corners & HUGE useful Footer)
*   Big Fonts highlighting User Comments
*   Social Media (Twitter)

I realize that this design is not perfect and the client might not like the color scheme, fonts etc… however this site is much easier to read and look at.  I was able to incorporate existing elements, such as the rotating Text, product features and You Tube ‘Commercial’ (a recent addition).  I’ve thought about actually coding this mockup and seeing if I can get my page to get a higher ranking that the actual [CollarCard.com][2] site… (devious, I know).

My advice to other designers is to NEVER accept work for less than you feel you are worth! Barter for services, work in some sort of Profit sharing, or spend that time playing Guitar Hero 5, fishing or do what I did and create a nice Mock-Up and Blog about it. I would love to hear your feedback and stories about low-ball projects or cheap clients you’ve had in the past.
