This post is a few weeks overdue… mainly since I shot EVERYTHING in RAW when the wife and I went to London.  I’ve come to love and despise shooting in the RAW (not to be confused with nude, in the buff, naked) for it’s versatility, amazing quality, higher TCOS (total cost of ownership), time it takes to convert everything, etc… etc.. etc…

On my Mac is was pretty easy to convert everything all at once in the RAW Photo Manager (not the exact name) with Photoshop, just keep in mind that I didn’t adjust any of the photos which is where the time consumption comes into play.  I think I got some amazing shots while in London, Big Ben, The Eye, The Train stop out in the sticks…  Some of the photos are under-exposed, some are over-exposed, there are some blurry images mixed in, yet there are quite a handful of really sharp, crisp amazing shots.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I did taking them and spending a week in London.
