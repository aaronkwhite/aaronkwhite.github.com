WordPress 2.7 (self-hosted) has been released.  Which is a good thing, although I wished they would have done this about a week ago.  I’m working on a couple install for the MySQL Replication & Backup and spent a ton of time getting 2.6.5 up and running.  2.7 has a bunch of interface features that would make managing a medium-high traffic Blog a little easier.  So I’m getting ready to do the Automatic upgrade via the WordPress Automatic Upgrade Plugin, which BTW isn’t needed any longer in 2.7…  Hopefully the upgrade goes well and my Template doean’t freak out.  Wish Me Luck!
