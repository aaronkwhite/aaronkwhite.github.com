Today is my first day of being recently un-employed… This post isn’t about how am I dealing with it or how am I finding a new job, although those are great questions I want to focus on more technology and Web Design. The first thing I had to do was buy a new laptop.  When I started working with MySQL they gave me a nice shiny new Macbook Pro (2008 Model), ever since then I am a complete convert! Now I have a nice new 2009 model Unibody Macbook Pro with a glossy screen and much improved battery.

I am going to try and focus on improving my design skills, programming, blogging and maybe an iPhone App (I have an idea, now I just need to figure out how to execute that idea).  My Macbook Pro:

A couple of weeks ago a high school friend asked on Facebook what she should do with her new Mac to get up to speed and what software she should be using, unfortunately I didn’t respond (other pressing issues in my life to deal with at the time).  I think the answer to the question varies for everyone, depending on how/what you will be doing with your Mac.  In my case this Mac will be used for Personal life use and my Web Development… Oh, I can’t forget it will be used to surf the Internets for my sister-n-laws baby shower, curtain rods and I imagine shoes… and I LOVE MY WIFE ![;-)][2]

Here are some of the ‘standard’ apps we use on a daily basis:

*   Safari (web browsing)
*   Mail (I’m currently evaluating Zimbra Desktop)
*   iTunes
*   [Text Wrangler][3] (Very good Text Editor)
*   iCal (connected to Google Calendar)
*   Address Book (Need quick access to the Xmas list)
*   Skype
*   [Tweetdeck][4] (Twitter & Facebook)
*   VmWare Fusion (sometimes you need windows)
*   Flip4Mac & Perian (watch any type of movie in Quicktime)
*   smcFanControl
*   Transmission
*   Handbrake (encode movies for your iPhone)
*   [The Unarchiver][5] (Best archive/zip utility)
*   [Dropbox][6] (Store your most important files in the cloud)
*   [Flickr Uploader][7]

Most of these applications are free or have paid upgrades, and I can’t imagine living without any of them.  Keep in mind there are alternatives but I prefer these apps.

Now for my Web Devleopment Apps:

*   Firefox (Need those Debugging Tools)
*   Chrome (Fast! Fast! Fast! plus supports CSS3 elements)
*   Espresso (recent improvements and the price point  made this app almost as great as Coda)
*   Adobe CS4 Master Collection
*   Cyberduck (Trusty FTP client)
*   Ubuntu (Dev Environment)
*   WordPress
*   Terminal
*   the Internets….

Everyday I think about how I ever made web pages without Adobe CS3/4, between Photoshop & Bridge alone for me it’s worth the $$$.  Again with any application there are alternatives… when working on MySQL.com I mainly used Komodo Edit (Free Version) to do everything, however with recent improvements I have come to love Espresso when writing code.  I think the last entry (the Internets…) is the most under appreciated resource for Web Design & Development.  I rely heavily upon Twitter and Google to find inspiration, tutorials, time wasters, etc…

So my plan for the futre (besides getting some more coffee) is to update My Portfolio, finish porting it over to WordPress, read a couple development books I’ve been meaning to devour for a while and of course find a new job.  In between there I will continue working on my house, exercise, complain about all the snow and I imagine have a few beers.
