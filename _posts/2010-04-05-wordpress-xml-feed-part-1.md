I’m having some issues trying to connect my iphone WordPress app to my blog. There seems to be some strange issue with my theme that is playing havoc with the XML. This post is helping me track down the error and hopefully I’ll be posting updates from my phone, or if anyone wants to buy me an iPad… ![:-D][1]
