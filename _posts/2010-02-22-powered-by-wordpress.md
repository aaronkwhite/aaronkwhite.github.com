I’ve been insanely busy over the last year with MySQL.com and moving to a new house that I never could find the time to consolidate my Portfolio & Blog into WordPress… that obviously has changed.  I like to think of this release as “aaronkwhite.com 2.5, powered by wordpress”.

I originally began hand coding all my .php files and found that I was running into crazy style bugs and struggled for a bit trying to straighten everything out. Then thanks to a good friend, I’ve discovered the [Whiteboard theme for WordPress][1]. Whiteboard is designed to speed up the process of designing and coding a WordPress theme by eliminating the time spent on WordPress’ back-end PHP that is used in every WordPress theme. Can you spell LIFE SAVER?  I would say that transferring my existing site into the Whiteboard frame work took me about two days working off and on a few hours a day.

There are still some items I need to work out, mainly updating the sidebar styling and the post meta info.  For now as most things in my life it’s a work in progress. I plan on spending time posting some more web related blogs and tweaking the site as much as possible.  So Welcome!
