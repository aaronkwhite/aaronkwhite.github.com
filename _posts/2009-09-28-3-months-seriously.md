Yeah, this has been by far the craziest summer of my life.  There are things which I’m not allowed to discuss (just google who I work for & EU), some product launches, a re-design and lots of other things have occupied my time this suumer.  I plan on writing very soon about some Design related topics, however I need to drop myself a note about VMWare Fusion and get back to work…  Don’t forget to follow my Twitter feed (I’m pretty active on Twitter) @aaronkwhite
