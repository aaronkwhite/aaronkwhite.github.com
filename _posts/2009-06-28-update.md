It always amazes me how busy someone can become and where blogging falls in the list of Priorities.  Obviously it’s pretty low and I’m trying to remedy that as best as possible.  There are a Ton of things going on right now, one of which I’m legally not allowed to discuss in the blogsphere (read my profile, look at my employer and you’ll see what I’m referring to).  I have a big project for MySQL I’m in the middle of, still need to keep it under wraps but I hope you’ll enjoy the outcome as much as I am creating it.  Personally, I’ve been trying to play more golf (doing pretty well at that), am attempting to do P90X, at this point I’m only doing certain workouts 1-2 times per week, I need to ride my bike some more…. can never get too much exercise I think.  Finally the wife and I should have some big news pretty soon, and unfortunately it’s not kids, Yet! ![;-)][1]

Regarding WordPress Theming, I’ve had to place this on the back burner for a bit, until I get some more free-time to focus on creating some themes, however it is still high on my list of things to get done.

For the near future I’m going to try and blog about some of the technical & personal stuff I’ve been doing (Short Blog Post on Ubuntu & VMWare Fusion coming shortly) and make an effort to blog at least 1 a week… I’m sorry to say that Twitter has started to consume some of my blogging cycles, guess I should find a way to incorporate both.  Thanks,
