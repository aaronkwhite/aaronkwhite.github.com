So recently I updated my site, including the latest version WordPress and a custom theme based on the whiteboard framework. It’s all pretty nifty, works great and frankly looks good.

With my older theme I was unable to use the WordPress iPhone app to access my site and post a new blog entry. I am now typing this post on my iPhone 3GS ( which is not the most ideal typing surface for a blog). I need to attribute this to the updates made to the WordPress iPhone app and the updates made with the Whiteboard framework.

That is all…
