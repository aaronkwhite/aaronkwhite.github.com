I’ve started to create a WordPress theme and plan on displaying my progress here.  Now I’ve been hacking WordPress themes for a while and find it to be pretty easy, especially for the common user.  The best thing about Wordpres IMHO is the community and the availability of plugins to customize your blog/site (ie. I’ve installed the Cumulus Tag Cloud,  NextGen Gallery for some of my photography and if you’re on IE6 a nice bright yellow bar suggesting you move to a modern browser).

WordPress Theming can be a very lucrative adventure if you have the time & skill to knock out some nice designs, or it can be a very rewarding non-lucrative venture ie. give away your stuff for free!  I’ve had a design I created in Photoshop a while back… it was going to be my [portfolio][1] site until I came up with something different.  So I decided to use it as a WordPress theme (which when complete will be available here for FREE, because everyone loves FREE BEER!). So here goes:

Step 1: Create your Layout (CHECK)

Step 2: Mockup Layout in XHTML & CSS (Almost There, screenshot below)

As always this takes a bit of time to make sure there are not any compatibility issues (which everyone knows there are!). I’ve decided for version .1 to stick with a basic 2 column blog layout with the sidebar on the right.  I’m working on on finishing all the little tiny layout styles (lists, forms, images, etc…) and I need to add the content for the sidebar, which will look similar to this site (at least for version .1)

Next Steps…  Here is my rough plan for executing this project, I’m sure there will be some issues but if there weren’t they this would not be any fun now would it ![:-)][3]

Step 3: Install MAMP (Check)

Step 4: Install Local WordPress & Thematic (Check)

Step 5: Separate XHTML/CSS page into WordPress files (header.php, footer.php, page.php)

Step 6: Cross Fingers, Pray to the Web Gods, Buy Lottery ticket and hope everything works as planned

Step 7: TEST, TEST & MORE TESTING

Step 8: Check Lottery Ticket #’s & realize I need to keep my day job

Step 9: Fix any issues that may arise

Step 10: Post theme here & WordPress.com, rinse & repeat as needed

So, over the next few weeks I have some updates (hopefully) and we’ll see how this goes.  If you have any questions/comments let me know.
