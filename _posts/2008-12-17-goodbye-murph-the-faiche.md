So, today is my 31st Birthday… Woo Hoo… but a little while ago I discovered that my family fish had passed… ‘Murph the Faiche’ Al and I picked up Murph at the Old Town Aquarium in Chicago in Sept. 2007. I was super excited about getting the Aquarium and it took 2 days to decide on which Beta we we’re gonna get. Murph Rocked! I remember the car ride home when Al and I argued about what we were gonna name him… I wanted to call him ‘Faiche the Fish’… so in the end (I can’t remember all names we went back & forth on) Al came up with Murphy… and then we finally decided on ‘Murph the Faiche’, which in the end turned out to be a great name… we can call him Murph or the faiche, whatever.

A few months ago we decided to move back to Denver and were SUPER worried about how he would handle the car ride, but he survived and was doing great. Lately it’s been really cold in the Denver area, but we have a nice ceramic heater for his tank and he had been fairly active, although he was not eating is normal amount of food the last couple of days (the last few days have been -7, 12 & 30 degrees), but Beta’s are pretty durable fish, so I wasn’t too worried.

I’m coming to the realization that he’s really gone and I’m pretty tore up about it. Murph was the best! He had a great personality, loved to swim, although he hated the 3 Amigos (a couple of really quick fish I put in his tank once for Exercise) we loved him a lot. Murph the Faiche you will be missed and I’m sorry you never got to meet Houston or had a permanent home, take care buddy!
