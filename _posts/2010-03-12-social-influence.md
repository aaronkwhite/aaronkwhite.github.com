I’ve been working pretty hard on Empire Avenue, can’t get into the details but in a few weeks I promise you will love the changes.  I wanted to share a little about what’s going on here.  Empire Avenue is a way for people to measure their Social Influence by being active on the web (Facebook, Twitter, Blogs) people can purchase Virtual shares in you or your company.  The more Influence you have on people the higher your stock will rise… in a nutshell!

Since we opened the Beta a few weeks ago we have seen a flury of activity not only on the site but people being more engaged online.  We have had a significant number of users sign up for Twitter accounts and others start using their existing accounts on a regular basis.  This is real interaction!

Last night I bought a bunch of shares in a new account Ticker ([MOMMAG][1]) for $10 per Virtual Share and started promoting her activity to Everyone I could!  I Posted Shouts throughout Empire Avenue & Sent a TON of Tweets about this user being my DarkHorse Stock of the Week… Oh and the fact that she’s William Shatner Approved.  The amazing part is she has a TON of investors now, her stock IS on the rise, she’s being active with her new Twitter Account & Facebook and others are responding.  One reply to my Shout Outs was Awesome!

It’s amazing to see everyone become MORE engaged and start really paying attention to what others are doing.  If you would like to get an invite to Empire Avenue, send  me a message and I’ll talk to the Wizard on your behalf.

Disclaimer: There are some concerns about insider trading.  While we are in our Beta testing period ALL EmpireAve employees have full access to the share exchange and are allowed to Buy & Sell Virtual Shares in Anyone.  Once we officially launch our accounts will become hybrid accounts… in that we will not be able to Buy & Sell virtual Shares and users will not be able to Buy & Sell our Virtual Shares.  It’s a Bummer, however to ensure complete integrity we do what we must!
