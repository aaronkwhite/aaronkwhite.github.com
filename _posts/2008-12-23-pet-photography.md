So I’m home (Wife’s Family) for the Holidays and wanted to get some new photos of Houston my Chocolate Labrador. As most people will attest to, getting any animal to sit still and stare at the camera is a difficult task. I have disovered the trick at least for a Lab… go play ball outside when it’s -7 F. Houston was so tired that it was actually pretty easy to get some good shots.
