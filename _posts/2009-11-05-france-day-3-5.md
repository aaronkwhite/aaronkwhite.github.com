I chose to work Mon-Wed to get a sense of French Life/Culture, Traveling to the Sun Velizey office to work on Monday where I visited the local Shopping Mall and flirted with the girls at the Sandwich counter ![:-D][1]  I guess I’m not surprised at how much America & France are… Big Box stores, Parents yelling at children although there seems to be something more refined when you yell at a child in French then in a very calm/cool voice finish with ‘Merci!’…  The Parking lot was full and crazy busy, there was tons of road construction, just a typical day.

Tues. & Wed. morning I worked from the Hotel…  I know what you’re saying ‘WHY?’, well the Trinion Palace is on the Versailles Palacde grounds and is beautiful, not to mention it has practically rained everyday since I landed…  I spent both days wandering the streets, buying groceries at the local market, baguette, AMAZING CHEESE! This time I got some sort of swiss-style cheese (no-holes) very mild and the most amazing BRIE I’ve ever had in my life.  It was VERY pungent but tasted wonderful, almost mild when eaten with bread.

In the afternoon I finally found a cafe’/Brasserie which had free WiFi, where I was able to work for a few hours, they didn’t have any working power outlets for customers, luckily I had a new battery for my Macbook.  The Cafe’ Au Lait was delicious as were the Biere’s (Kronenberg 1664).

Having spent a decent amount of time wandering Versailles I happened upon a Thai restuarant, where we had dinner on Wed. evening.  The Food as I suspected was amazing, you could tell they used fresh ingredients from the local market and for 22 Euros you could get a 3 course meal with a drink…  A decent price considering the amount of food they give you.

I have fully enjoyed my days in Versailles living amongst the people, attempting to communicatre and not offend anyone, although the Manager at the Cafe’ with Free WiFi keept shooting me nasty looks and twice rebooted the internet router for no appearent reason, I’m assuming to try and get me to leave… Didn’t work but that could be attributed to my stuborn nature and the lack of other WiFi options.  I am however ready for my adventures in Paris, so I bid you Adu!
