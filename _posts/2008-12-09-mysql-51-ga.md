So the original title to this post was going to be: ‘**SVN – The BANE of my existence…**‘  however upgrading our SVN Server to 1.5.4 (Latest Release) has proven to be well worth the time and made the Launch a piece of cake!

I guess I need to let you know that about 6 months ago I started my new Gig as a Web Developer for MySQL (www.mysql.com), which is now owned by my former employer Sun Microsystems.  This is the greatest job I’ve EVER had!  I work remotely mainly from home, but as long as I have an internet connection I’m golden…  My team is made up of some of the Smartest, Creative & Funniest people I’ve ever known.  Anywho…

So a couple weeks before the launch I was trying to sync my 5.1 branch with our main MySQL repo and had ALL KINDS of issues… Conflicts were coming out of the unkonwns, changes I wanted to keep were overwritten… it was a mess.  Then, we were able to convince our Sys Admin to upgrade to the new SVN 1.5.4 Server and reload our repos.  OMG!  I Synced my local branch copy and only recieved 12 conflicts…  most were images that were updated recently.  Anyway, I’m a HUGE fan of the new SVN version especially with the new Merge tracking… this way you don’t have to specify which versions you want to merge… Very Easy…

So Needless to say the the launch was a Success!  Which is always a good thing…  So MySQL 5.1 is now live, you can download it [HERE][2].  And yes we’re using 5.1 on the webiste.  ![:-)][3]
