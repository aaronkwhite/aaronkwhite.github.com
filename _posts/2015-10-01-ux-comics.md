This is a presentation I gave on using Comics as a medium to tell stories and validate ideas as a part of Denver Startup Week 2015.

In today's rapidly-evolving business environment, shared understanding is easily attainable. Communicating complex ideas or processes quickly and effectively is automatic. FALSE! Communicating with humans is very hard work, and writing documentation sucks. When it comes to quick, clear and effective communication, visuals trump text and conversation every time. Comics tell stories about your users and products in an interesting and captivating way. Learn how to create and utilize UX comics to visually tell a story that resonates to product owners, stakeholders, engineers and the users.
