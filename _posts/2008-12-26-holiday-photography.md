Here are some photos from Christmas Day.  The 25th was pretty awsome, I made breakfast for everyone… however the waffles turned out a little thicker than normal.  Other than that I think Christmas turned out pretty well.  I wish I could have gotten a couple shots of the Ribs that were slow cooked for about 8 hours in a brown sugar dry rub…  man they were delicious.

My favorite photos are of the train & tree, which I could stop and then take the shot.  I did have a couple of issues with the lighting (none of which I posted).  Let me know what you think!
