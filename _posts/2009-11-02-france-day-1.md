I arrived in Paris on Saturday around 8:30am local time and surprisingliy wasn’t too tired.  I attribute this to flying a United 767 Business Class from Chicago to Charles Degaulle.  Recently United upgraded thier Business Class to full lay down seats which made the 7hr flight quite enjoyable.  Getting out of the airport took some time but I managed to find the train station and eventually made it to my hotel in Versailles (The Trinion Placace Versailles)

My first impressions:

1.  France is BEAUTIFUL.  The trees are turning colors and the leaves are falling which make the scenery unbelievable.
2.  Architecture in Paris & Versailles is amazing.  You can really take in all the history and culture just by walking down the streets.  The buildings, bridges, churches etc… all have this old world essence to them which is amazing.
3.  Wifi connections are spotty at best.  I was able to sign up to boingo.com while in Chicago and get a Unlimited European connection plan for $60 USD.  I keep dropping the connection and have to re-login every few mintues.  I’m hoping this improves over the next few days which I think it will.
4.  Speaking Spanish phrases instead of Frech really pisses off the waiters.  Being a Texan, it’s somewhat engraved in my DNA to say ‘Thank You’, ‘Please’, ‘Hello’ and such in Spanish.  Though when you talk to a French person and say Si’ or Por Favor, then tend to not take care of you…  In my case I had to request a coffee refill 4 times…  So I will be making sure to repeat the 3 French words over and over again in my head, hopefully before I leave this won’t be an issue.  We shall see.
