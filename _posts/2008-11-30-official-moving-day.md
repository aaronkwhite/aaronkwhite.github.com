Today I have officially signed off from my old [Blogger Blog] I have configured my new WordPress BLOG at least as a good starting point.  In the near future, I will be adding some new posts to the Photography page, updating the main page with a plethora of new posts.  Actually I have a ton of stuff I need to catch up on… Such as:

 [1]: http://sudoaptget.blogspot.com/2008/08/comcast-bandwith-limits.html

*   My Ubuntu 8.10 upgrade
*   Bandwidth Usage Update for October
*   My Wife’s trip to Moscow
*   Thanksgiving 2008
*   Much Much More…

So sudoaptget.blogspot.com was a great starting point, but WordPress is the future… at least until I find something new ![:-)][2]
