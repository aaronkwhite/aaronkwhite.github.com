This design template was created to help designers jumpstart their [Bootstrap][1] projects. Recently I’ve found myself relying on the many great features of Bootstrap when designing apps and have become growingly frustrated with having to create the default grid in Illustrator & Photoshop from scratch… I was very surprised to see that Bootstrap templates don’t already exist, so I created this one and am sharing it with the world. The grid layout is based on the default 12 column grid released in the 2.0 version of [Bootstrap][1].

This template is free to use for any projects (personal & commercial), all I ask is you don’t take credit for my work or the guys who created [Bootstrap][1].

Please send feedback via [Twitter][3] or in the comments below, if you notice any major flaws please let me know…
