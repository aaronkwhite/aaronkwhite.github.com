I’ve spent the last 2 months working on a re-design in my spare time (what little of it I have) and have finally pushed the live button this morning.  I was asked recently what was my ‘process’ for designing my personal site and I struggled to answer this question.

I think my main goal this time around was to NOT use the color blue!  The last few sites I’ve been involved with relied heavily upon various shades of blue and I really needed to get do something different.  When mocking up my new design in Photoshop it didn’t really dawn upon me until I started coding the site that I went with a Monochromatic color scheme, which allowed me to showcase my featured works and photography.

The other goal in doing any version of my Portfolio site is to showcase my skills, I tend to do this not only with my Portfolio list but the actual site & design itself.  I think some times the Delivery gets a bit lost in translation compared to the showcase of other work.  I know (as of this writing) that there are a few very minor bugs I need to address and I will get to those when I get back home, otherwise I think everything turned out nicely.

The site is a custom WordPress theme, where every post, page & blog entry are taking advantage of everything WordPress.  I would love any feedback (positive or negative), you can jump over to my [contact page][1].  Thanks,
