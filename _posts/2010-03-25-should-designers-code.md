There almost always seems to a a discussion or argument about whether Web Designers should know how to code. There are like 25 schools of thought around this topic, some say YES! others say NO! some folks think it depends, etc… Having spent the last 3 weeks or so working on design enhancements for Empire Avenue, I have come to the realization; at least for me personally that you should at the very least be comfortable in the trenches. If you spend all day in front of Adobe then you are a Graphics Designer, not a Web Designer. Web Design is the ability to use your creativity to solve problems (Design a website or interface) and then apply your skills to implement the solution.

As an example I was brought into Empire Avenue to improve the site interface, now Empire Avenue is built on a custom PHP MVC framework called Demon Core (someday it will be open sourced) which is modeled after Zend but much faster and easier to work with. If you are a Designer and don’t have a clue what MVC is, then you would be in trouble! (Model, View, Controller) ![:-D][1]

Building websites can be easy, however building large websites or web applications can be a pain and if you aren’t able to understand what is going on in your coding flavor of choice it is going to be almost impossible to implement your solutions. I’m not talking about creating the core back-end code, just the front-end interface… Having to rely upon others to make stuff work gets old very quickly for them and your project will suffer.

I guess my point is to be an good/decent  effective Web Designer, you need to understand what you’re working with (code and what not) and not be afraid of the code or framework.  I do realize that there are situations (shops) where Web Designers play in Adobe all day long and make really awesome pictures of sites and UI Engineers build it, which to me makes you a Graphics Designer… I’m just saying!
