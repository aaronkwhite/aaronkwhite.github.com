[![Orange Calendar Icons - 12 Months][2]][2]
Orange Calendar Icons - 12 Months

I am SO excited about this…  For as long as I can remember I have always used other people’s images, artwork, wallpapers etc…  Well not any longer.  Today I FINALLY get to give back to the community!

I have created a set of Calendar icons to use, well anywhere you like.  My original intent was to create an orange themed set of calendar icons that I could use in a new WordPress install for work.  Well I have succeeded thanks to a couple of Photoshop tutorials I found on Google.  I have not come up with a cool name or anything for this set (Maybe after I drink some more coffee), so I’m just calling it ‘**Orange Calendar Icons**‘…

This is my first attempt at anything like this, so please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions.  Anyone is free to use these images for anything they wish, all I ask is you do not claim ownership…  Later today  I will upload the original PSD which has the 31 days and a blank calendar so you can use CSS style in WordPress to do your own text and dates.  Enjoy!
