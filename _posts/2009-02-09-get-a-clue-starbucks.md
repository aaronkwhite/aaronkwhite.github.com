You can file this post under Random, but I could not resist sharing my shock.  Today Starbucks announced that they are going to unveil an F’n Value Menu.  Yes the company that brought the no-foam, half-caff, skinny, vente latte out of the drudges of the whole in the wall beatnick coffee houses of the pacific northwest is joining the ranks of Ronald McDonald, the King (who I believe is on a really bad acid trip), and that square burger prostitute Wendy!

I like most people used to (most people still do) spent a small fortune on Vente Mochas, Latte’s, South American drips and the occasional frappuccin0.  Now everyone knows that SB started to go downhill when providing a good cup of coffee or nice latte was not enough…  Everyone needs a good pastry… and bottled water… and sparkling water… and cookies… and cupcakes… and yogurt parfaits… and lunch… and hot sandwiches… the list goes on and on… you get the idea.  I would say starting about 5-6 years ago Starbucks coffee started to become bitter, burnt and over priced.  First is was with the whole beans and then the price increases on EVERYTHING ELSE.  Oh and when you spend $6 on a Grande Mocha that has been watered down… this is where I draw the line.

Starting Monday you can get a coffee & pastry for $5 (I’m estimating taxes).  Hey! Starbucks!  No you are not immune to the economic climate, yes you built too many stores (although you closed some of them) but for the LOVE OF A DECENT COFFEE, DO NOT sell a Happy Meal!  Don’t spend THOUSANDS of dollars on a machine that makes the perfect cup of coffee\***|  Get back to basics, stay true to your brand.  Start buying/growing good coffee beans, or sell that business to someone else and BUY GOOD COFFEE.  Everyone knows that good beans make a good cup of coffee!

TRAIN YOUR STAFF!  Now I have never worked in a coffee house, honestly I have never made a latte, however I DO know that you DO NOT take a spoon and push foam into the cup!  Go spend some time in a real coffee house, you know… your ROOTS!  I saw on the Food Network once a latte making competition, where they made designs in the foam (apples, leaves) start making real real coffee again.  Lower your prices, quit selling all the CRAP, like *Barry Manilow albums and get back to basics!* Make a REAL cup of Coffee…

A Decent Latte!

*\***| Just for the record Starbucks is planning on spending a ton of money on a machine for all their stores that makes the ‘Perfect’ cup of coffee.  Get Real, a machine doesn’t make the perfect cup of coffee alone, you need quality beans! *
