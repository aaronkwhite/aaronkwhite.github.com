Welcome to my BRAND NEW BLOG via WordPress! Woo F’n Hoo!!! I am currently in the process of moving my former blog () to my new branded domain Blog using WordPress. There are a couple reasons for doing this… mainly I’m an IT Nerd (according to the wife), I’ve always wanted to use Word Press (I like the vast number of templates, plugins, and I prefer to be in control) and I could not for the life of me get the stupid ‘Read More’ link to work in Blogger.

This Blog is going to be my little spot in Cyber-Space to accomplish the following:

*   Share my experiences in the world of Technology
*   Ramble about the shite that annoys me
*   Share some of the Random Amusing’s I find
*   Use this as a forum for my Photography Hobby
*   Anything else I decide to post… hey, it’s MY Blog!

Be prepared for this site to change at Random times, depending upon when I implement new WordPress plugins, or I find a new Theme that I like, or I decide Pink is going to be the color of the week…

Anyway, I’d like to thank Blogger for tieing me over for the last year or so while I solidified the essence of my Blog.  Hey Blogger!  It’s Been Real!  It’s Been Fun!  But NOT REAL FUN!
