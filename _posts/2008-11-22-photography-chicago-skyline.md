So For my first photography submssion I thouht I should share the photo I used to make my banner image.  The photo was taken on Sept. 19th 2008 in Chicago, IL.  I used my Nikon D40 with the 18-55mm lens (this is currently my only setup).  As I’m fairly new to this, I don’t really know what the F-stop or apature settings or any of the other settings were, although I did change the exposure quite a bit, you can see all the photos from this round [here][1].
